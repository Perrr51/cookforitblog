Hello, and welcome to the first entry of my blog, _second brain_, or progress journal that I am building. My current situation is as follows: I am in Switzerland, working in a sector I don’t enjoy, and I feel that my life has taken a direction that doesn’t excite me. That’s why, and to force myself to change, I’ve decided to start this project. My goal is that, entry by entry and project by project, my career in the technology sector will start to take shape.

I will update each section according to what I am working on or the project I am doing at the time. As I mentioned earlier, I am currently in a foreign country and in a field that doesn’t motivate me, so I have decided to make a change, pack my bags once again, and return to Spain to get to work and give my life a new direction.
