## Welcome to My Second Brain: A Journal of Change and Progress

![Mi foto](/images/prueba1.jpeg)

Have you ever felt like your life needs a new direction? So have I. I’m Miguel Ángel, and this blog is my personal space to document my journey of professional and personal transformation.

After years working in a field I’m not passionate about and living abroad, I’ve decided to take a bold step: return to Spain and reinvent my career in the technology sector. Here, you’ll find my progress journal, the projects I’m working on, and the studies I’m undertaking to achieve my goals.

**What can you expect from this blog?**

- Honest entries about my progress, challenges, and lessons learned.
    
- Practical projects that reflect my professional growth.
    
- Resources and reflections for anyone seeking change in their own lives.
    

This is my second brain—a space to think out loud, learn, and share. If you’re also looking for inspiration to change your path, join me on this journey.
